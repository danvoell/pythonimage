# pythonimage

What this does is takes a picture (ob.png), adds a border and puts it on a background (wood.jpg). The original intent was a script that takes an images makes it look like a sticker decal that has been printed. Then it reorients the sticker and puts it on a wooden background to make it look real. We never quite got to the realistic looking part. Let me know if you get there! If you have any questions or if there is a python pillow image batch process you need help with, hit me up.
